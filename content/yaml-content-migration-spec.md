# YAML Content Layer — Migration Spec

> **Goal:** Replace the current hardcoded `content/data.typ` + `content/master-list.md` duality with a single YAML-based canonical content layer.
> **Consumers:** Typst (CV PDF, 3 variants filtered by priority) + Astro (website, unconstrained).
> **Editor:** LLM (you). The YAML files are what you write to when Werner says "update my resume."
> **Source of truth:** `content/experience.yaml`, `content/star-stories.yaml`, `content/config.yaml`
> **Stakeholder:** Life OS Assistant (spec author). Dev Agent (executor): implement the Typst import changes and YAML files. Werner: content owner.
> **Branch:** `feat/001-typst-cv-migration/yaml-content-migration` (create new)

## Why This Change

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `data.typ` and `master-list.md` duplicate the same content in different formats | One YAML file, both consume from it |
| Updating a bullet requires touching multiple files | Edit one YAML file |
| Typst hardcodes data in Typst syntax, not portable | YAML is language-agnostic, parseable by Astro too |
| No curation metadata exists | `cv_priority`, `website_show` tags in YAML |
| No single place to see "everything I've done" | The YAML is the catalog |

    isolation, and building resilient automation and deployment pipelines.

# AI policy (shown on website, omitted from CV due to space)
ai_policy:
  - "I treat AI as an agentic partner within a strict engineering framework, moving beyond 'vibe-coding' to structured, audit-ready workflows."
  - "Spec-Driven Development (SDD): Prioritize context-heavy specifications to ensure alignment; AI-generated outputs are treated as hypotheses validated by human-led TDD."
  - "Data Security: Enforce mandatory sandboxing for all agentic projects; strictly prohibit credential access and utilize tool-based retrieval for scoped, anonymized data only."
  - "Engineering Rigour: All AI-assisted output undergoes rigorous human-in-the-loop review."
  - "Privacy by Design: AI workflows are architected to avoid direct database access."

# Job target
job_target: |
  Seeking a mid to senior software engineering role (remote preferred, hybrid
  max. 2 days/week on-site in Cape Town) with emphasis on embedded systems,
  backend services, or AI-assisted development workflows.

      I used perf to profile the hot paths during live requests, generated
      flamegraphs, and traced the problem to JSON serialization in the
      request handling loop. Verbose logging on every JSON operation made
      it worse. I disabled the unnecessary logging via a config toggle as
      a first step. I then participated in the design discussion and helped
      drive the effort to phase out JSON entirely through a complete
      architecture redesign for dynamic payload creation. I self-taught the
      SOME/IP protocol from specs to ensure the new approach was
      spec-compliant.
    result: >
      Removing verbose logging alone improved some request calls by 80%.
      The full architecture redesign eliminated the bottleneck long-term,
      restoring full functionality for customers.

Include all 14 stories matching `content/star-stories.md`. Keep the same content; just reformat into YAML.

## Typst Migration Plan

### Step 1: Create the YAML files (content/*.yaml)

Write all 6 YAML files by extracting data from:
- `content/data.typ` (experience, education, skills, projects, config)
- `content/master-list.md` (cv_priority, website_show, star_ref curation metadata)
- `content/star-stories.md` (14 full stories)

The `cv_priority` field is NEW — it curates what fits on one page. Rules:
- **priority 1** = essential, always include in CV
- **priority 2** = include if space permits after priority 1 bullets
- **priority 3** = website-only (CV too long)

### Step 2: Simplify `content/data.typ`

The old `data.typ` is 298 lines of hardcoded data. Replace it with a thin YAML-import layer:

```typst
// content/data.typ — now a thin YAML import layer
// The canonical data lives in content/*.yaml

#import "@preview/yaml:0.2.0": yaml

// Read raw data from YAML files
#let _raw_config = yaml("content/config.yaml")
#let _raw_experience = yaml("content/experience.yaml")
#let _raw_education = yaml("content/education.yaml")
#let _raw_skills = yaml("content/skills.yaml")
#let _raw_projects = yaml("content/projects.yaml")

// Helper: filter bullets for a variant and max priority
#let _filter_bullets(bullets, variant, max_priority: 3) = {
  bullets
    .filter(b => b.variant == variant)
    .filter(b => b.cv_priority <= max_priority)
    .map(b => b.text)
}

// Helper: build experience entries for a variant
#let _build_experience(roles, variant) = {
  roles.map(r => (
    role: r.roles.at(variant),
    company: r.company,
    location: r.location,
    start_date: r.start_date,
    end_date: r.end_date,
    description: _filter_bullets(r.bullets, variant),
  ))
}

// Build education for variant
#let _build_education(entries, variant) = {
  entries.map(e => (
    degree: e.degree,
    institution: e.institution,
    location: e.location,
    graduation_year: e.graduation_year,
    details: e.details.at(variant, default: e.details.at("general")),
  ))
}

// Build skills for variant
#let _build_skills(categories, variant) = {
  categories.filter(c => c.variant == variant)
}

// Build projects for variant
#let _build_projects(entries, variant) = {
  entries.filter(e =>
    "variant_tags" in e and variant in e.variant_tags
  ).map(e => (
    name: e.name,
    description: e.description.at(variant, default: ()),
    link: e.link,
  ))
}

// Export: data dictionary matching old schema
// The template calls data.at("experience"), data.at("summary"), etc.
#let raw_data = {
  // This is populated per-variant below
  (
    name: _raw_config.name,
    email: _raw_config.email,
    phone: _raw_config.phone,
    location: _raw_config.location,
    github: _raw_config.github,
    website: _raw_config.website,
    linkedin: _raw_config.linkedin,
    position: _raw_config.position,
    summary: _raw_config.summary,
    certification: _raw_config.certification,
    ai_policy: _raw_config.ai_policy,
    job_target: _raw_config.job_target,
    // Will be resolved per variant
  )
}

// Variant-specific exports — these match what cv.typ imports
// The template already calls _resolve(data, variant) which handles dictionaries
// So we can either:
// A) Export the raw data and let _resolve handle variant selection
// B) Export pre-built variant dicts

#let cv_data = {
  // Re-exports the full data dictionary; template._resolve handles variant lookups.
  // Experience, etc. are stored as raw YAML lists, the template resolves them.
  raw_data + (
    experience: _raw_experience.roles,
    education: _raw_education.entries,
    skills: _raw_skills.categories,
    projects: _raw_projects.entries,
  )
}

// NOTE: The template.typ _resolve function already handles
// variant-aware dictionaries. For experience entries, the template
// expects a list of dicts with (role, company, ...). Currently the
// template calls _resolve_entries which resolves role and description
// by variant. The YAML layer replaces that: role comes from roles.general/systems/infra,
// description comes from filtered bullets.
```

**IMPORTANT:** The template's `_resolve_entries` function expects `role` and `description` fields to be variant-aware dictionaries. The new data layer needs to either:
- (A) Keep the existing template logic and have `data.typ` pre-build variant-resolved lists — simpler, fewer template changes
- (B) Change the template to use the flatter YAML structure — cleaner long-term

**Recommendation: Option A** — keep template changes minimal. Have `data.typ` pre-build variant-resolved lists before exporting. That way `template.typ` barely changes.

```typst
// Pre-resolved export for each variant (Option A)
// cv.typ calls: render_cv(cv_data, variant: "general")
// cv_data already has variant-resolved experience, education, skills, etc.

#let cv_data = {
  // The template already calls _resolve on position, summary (variant-aware dicts)
  // For experience lists, we pre-resolve them before export
  let all_roles = _raw_experience.roles
  
  raw_data + (
    experience_entries_general: _build_experience(all_roles, "general"),
    experience_entries_systems: _build_experience(all_roles, "systems"),
    experience_entries_infra: _build_experience(all_roles, "infrastructure"),
    education_general: _build_education(_raw_education.entries, "general"),
    education_systems: _build_education(_raw_education.entries, "systems"),
    education_infra: _build_education(_raw_education.entries, "infrastructure"),
    skills_general: _build_skills(_raw_skills.categories, "general"),
    skills_systems: _build_skills(_raw_skills.categories, "systems"),
    skills_infra: _build_skills(_raw_skills.categories, "infrastructure"),
  )
}
```

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The current template `template.typ` already has a function `_resolve(value, variant)` that handles the variant lookup pattern. And the data dict uses the same pattern — `summary` is a dict with variant keys, `position` is a dict with variant keys.

The `_resolve_entries` function in the template also resolves `role` and `description` by variant when those fields are dictionaries.

So the minimal-change approach is:
1. Keep the YAML data structured similarly to the current Typst data
2. Template.typ barely changes — `_resolve` and `_resolve_entries` already handle variant lookup
3. `data.typ` just becomes an import layer that reads YAML and exports in the same shape

Let me simplify the approach. The migration should be mechanical, not introducing new complexity.

Actually, I think the cleanest approach is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think about what the dev agent needs to know:

1. Create YAML files from existing data
2. Update `content/data.typ` to read YAML instead of hardcoding
3. Minor template adjustments if needed

The key new thing is the `cv_priority` and `website_show` fields that don't exist currently. But I can handle that.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating the spec document. Let me write it clearly with the recommendation and let the dev agent figure out the exact Typst implementation details. The point of the spec is to describe the architecture and the migration steps, not to write the Typst code.

Let me simplify the document.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>

## Why

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `data.typ` and `master-list.md` duplicate the same data in different formats | One YAML file, both consume it |
| No curation metadata exists — can't distinguish "must fit on CV" from "nice to have on website" | `cv_priority` (1-3) and `website_show` tags per bullet |
| Data locked in Typst syntax, not portable to Astro | YAML is language-agnostic |
| Editing requires touching multiple files | Edit one YAML file |

## Curation Strategy: `cv_priority` + `website_show`

Every bullet in `experience.yaml` carries two curation tags:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `cv_priority` | 1, 2, 3 | 1=essential (on every CV variant), 2=include if space permits, 3=website only |
| `website_show` | true / false | Show on website (no page limit, so most are true) |

**CV compilation logic per variant:**
1. Filter bullets by `variant` (general/systems/infrastructure)
2. Include all `cv_priority: 1` bullets
3. Add `cv_priority: 2` bullets until page is full
4. Drop anything that doesn't fit one page
5. Never include `cv_priority: 3` in CV

**Website logic:**
- Show all `website_show: true` bullets
- Expand STAR-referenced bullets with full S/T/A/R narrative
- No page limit

---

## Curation Metadata for All Bullets

Each bullet in `experience/roles[].bullets[]` gets these fields (currently exist only in master-list.md as ad-hoc cross-references):

```yaml
- text: "Used perf profiling and flamegraphs to trace a performance bottleneck..."
  variant: systems
  cv_priority: 1              # NEW — essential for systems CV
  website_show: true          # NEW — show on website
  star_ref: 1                 # LINKS to star-stories.yaml story id: 1
```

Rules for assigning `cv_priority`:
- **priority 1** — strongest impact metric, core differentiator, primary technical achievement
- **priority 2** — good supporting detail, shows breadth, fills space
- **priority 3** — operational/maintenance work, interesting but not essential for recruiter scan

All existing bullets from `data.typ` and `master-list.md` must be migrated with appropriate tags.

---

## Migration Steps (for dev agent)

### Step 1: Create 6 YAML files from existing data

| YAML file | Source | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `config.yaml` | `data.typ` cv_data block (name, email, phone, location, github, linkedin, position, summary, certification, ai_policy, job_target) | Also pull website URL from cv_data |
| `experience.yaml` | `data.typ` `_experience_entries` + `master-list.md` bullet text and cross-refs | Add `cv_priority` and `website_show` based on master-list priority order (first bullets = higher priority) |
| `star-stories.yaml` | `star-stories.md` | Same content, reformat to YAML list |
| `skills.yaml` | `data.typ` `_skill_categories` | Same structure, format to YAML |
| `projects.yaml` | `data.typ` `_project_entries` | Include variant_tags |
| `education.yaml` | `data.typ` `_education_entries` | Include per-variant details |

### Step 2: Replace `content/data.typ`

Current: 298 lines of hardcoded Typst data.
New: A thin YAML-import layer that:
1. Reads all 6 YAML files using `yaml()` function
2. Builds experience entry lists (filtered by variant + priority)
3. Re-exports everything in the shape `template.typ` expects

**Typst YAML import options:**
- **Preferred:** `#import "@preview/yaml:0.2.0": yaml` (community package)
- **Fallback:** Typst 0.12+ has built-in `yaml()` — check `typst --version` first
- Use whichever works reliably

### Step 3: Minor `template.typ` adjustments

The template currently expects `experience_entries` to be a list with variant-resolved fields. After migration:
- Data comes from YAML, filtered by cv_priority
- The field naming might differ slightly — align template if needed
- Test all 3 variants compile identically

### Step 4: Delete `content/master-list.md`

This file is superseded by the YAML layer. After verifying everything compiles:
- `git rm content/master-list.md`
- Or keep as a regenerated reference doc driven by a script

### Step 5: Verify

- Run `mise run check` (regression test)
- `typst compile cv.typ` — compare output PDF visually with current
- `typst compile cv_embedded.typ` — verify same
- `typst compile cover_letter.typ` — verify unchanged

---

## CV Priority Assignments (Draft)

For the dev agent as a starting point. These can be tuned.

### Divergent Tabletop
- **Priority 1:** Founding mission + all systems bullets (CRDT, sub-50ms, supervision tree)
- **Priority 2:** Additional infra bullets (buffer strategy, Ecto.Multi, RLS)
- **Priority 3:** Universal Design bullet

### FARO Africa
- **Priority 1:** ERPNext extension + NFC app + UX improvement (STAR 9) + LLM workflows + Python simulators (systems)
- **Priority 2:** Retool migration + AWS provisioning + BLE tooling
- **Priority 3:** General maintenance bullets + NFC scanner utility + Docker infra

### Ingenics Digital
- **Priority 1:** FSM framework (STAR 5) + Python tooling + WBUS3 protocol (STAR 6)
- **Priority 2:** ESP32 dev + BLE stack + Cap'n Proto IPC + HW mocks (infra)
- **Priority 3:** QP active object + ESP32 concurrent (systems)

### UMAN Technologies
- **Priority 1:** SOME/IP perf (STAR 1, 80% metric) + IPC layer (STAR 4) + HW mocks (STAR 3) + Docker container (STAR 2)
- **Priority 2:** General SOME/IP + Cap'n Proto + Agile lead
- **Priority 3:** (none — all bullets here are strong)

### North-West University
- **Priority 1:** Only one bullet. Always include in general.
- **Priority 3:** For systems/infrastructure variants (omit from CV to save space)

---

## Future: Website Integration

Not part of this migration, but the architecture enables it cleanly:

```
website/                        # Astro project
├── src/content/                # Astro content collections
│   ├── experience.yaml         # symlink -> ../../content/experience.yaml
│   ├── star-stories.yaml       # symlink -> ../../content/star-stories.yaml
│   └── ...
```

Astro reads the same YAML. The website renders every bullet where `website_show: true`, and expands `star_ref` links into full S/T/A/R sections on case study pages.

---
