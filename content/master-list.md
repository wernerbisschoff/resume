# Experience Master — Werner Bisschoff

> **Provenance:** This file was deleted in commits `eaea4b2` and `7263bfb` (June 2026) on the grounds that it was "fully superseded by the YAML content layer." That claim was inaccurate: a 7-bullet audit (July 2026) found 4 drift items and 1 missing entry between this master and `content/experience.yaml`. The file was recovered from `f6c86eb` and re-added as a human reference; the YAML remains the compile-time source of truth.

This is the canonical source of truth for all CV content.
Each CV variant (general / systems / infrastructure) curates from this document.
**STAR stories** (Amazon LP format) are in `content/star-stories.yaml` and cross-referenced below.

> **ATS guard:** Never include Expo, React Native, or front-end/mobile frameworks on the infrastructure variant.
> These trigger front-end ATS classification, preventing platform/infrastructure role matching.
> The general and systems variants may include them where contextually relevant (e.g., NFC scanner utilities).

### General / Systems / Infrastructure
- **Role (general):** Founder and Host
- **Role (systems):** Principal Systems Architect
- **Role (infrastructure):** Principal Systems Architect
- **Dates:** Jul 2025 – Present

#### General bullets
- Founded neurodivergent-focused peer community; manage event operations and WhatsApp-based community platform.
- Applied systems thinking to solve community management challenges through software solutions.

#### Systems bullets
- Engineered a distributed real-time data engine utilizing Elixir/OTP and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT models). Deployed in-memory GenServer storage buffers with threshold-based flush mechanics to limit direct database write transactions under sustained edit workloads.
- Integrated a Rust-backed CRDT synchronization layer (y_ex) using actor-based concurrency, achieving sub-50ms convergence latency across distributed editing sessions through deterministic state reconciliation and binary delta serialization.
- Designed a dynamic BEAM supervision tree with one_for_one isolation, encapsulating each page editing session in its own process subtree to prevent cascading failures and guarantee per-session state integrity.

#### Infrastructure bullets
- Engineered and hosted an enterprise-grade documentation ecosystem.
- Implemented a single-database multi-tenant separation engine using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) and transaction-scoped local parameters (SET LOCAL), enforcing strict data silos across isolated groups.
- Designed an atomic asynchronous flush strategy using in-memory GenServer storage buffers to limit database write transactions under sustained user interaction.
- Utilized Ecto.Multi atomic chains and Oban transactional background workers to ensure multi-stage backend edits (e.g., structural document renaming and incoming backlink indexing) execute completely or roll back safely.
- Applied Universal Design and Executive Functioning support models to product UX/UI; established highly structured, low-context asynchronous operational playbooks that minimized cognitive friction for contributors.

- Engineered lock-free asynchronous device management services bridging hardware peripherals with application layers.
- Built Python-based hardware peripheral simulators to catch edge-case device state corruptions prior to flashing.
- Introduced LLM-assisted development workflows to improve debugging speed and code review throughput.

#### Infrastructure bullets
- [STAR 9] Identified poor UX as root cause of recurring user errors — pushed back against "training gap" framing, proposed user research to validate, and drove UX improvements that reduced task completion time and error rates.
- Refactored and extended ERPNext via Python and JavaScript server hooks, optimizing pricing matrices and BI reporting.
- Architected migration of internal Retool workflows to Expo/React Native, reducing vendor licensing overhead.
- Built custom NFC scanner utilities within Expo for instantaneous physical inventory syncs.
- Provisioned and maintained a secure virtualized Linux infrastructure environment using Docker Compose for container isolation and writing custom backup and monitoring scripts.
- Diagnosed and resolved issues in a large existing ERPNext installation; introduced LLM-assisted debugging workflows.

## 4. UMAN Technologies | Century City, Cape Town

- **Role (general):** Software Developer
- **Role (systems):** Software Developer
- **Role (infrastructure):** Infrastructure & Tooling Developer
- **Dates:** Mar 2021 – Dec 2022
- **STAR stories:** 1 (Dive Deep — SOME/IP perf), 2 (Bias for Action — Docker), 3 (Deliver Results — HW mocks), 4 (Ownership — IPC)

#### General bullets
- Implemented SOME/IP RPC services; optimized performance bottlenecks with perf.
- Built IPC/RPC layers (C++/Python) using Cap'n Proto; led small team using Agile practices.

#### Systems bullets
- [STAR 1] Used perf profiling and flamegraphs to trace a performance bottleneck to JSON serialization and verbose logging in a SOME/IP request handling loop. Eliminated unnecessary logging via config toggle reducing latency by ~80%, then drove an architecture redesign to phase out JSON entirely.
- [STAR 4] Sole owner of an IPC service layer — studied existing node schema, designed node structures and data contracts, and implemented the communication layer enabling the frontend to consume the service.
- [STAR 3] Built Python-based SOME/IP hardware mocks that simulated request/response behavior; integrated into CI so automated tests ran without physical hardware.

#### Infrastructure bullets
- [STAR 2] Proactively created a Docker development container replicating the exact hardware environment — including VLAN and networking configuration — reducing setup time from hours to under an hour and enabling remote teams to develop without physical hardware.
- [STAR 3] Built Python hardware mocks simulating SOME/IP behavior; integrated into CI to enable automated testing without physical hardware, improving test coverage and developer productivity.
