"""Integration tests for CLI application with fetch, analyze, and review commands.

RED PHASE: These tests define the expected behavior.
They will FAIL until the CLI module is fully implemented.

Tests use Typer's CliRunner to invoke the CLI and verify:
1. fetch command reads search terms and calls scraper
2. analyze command loads jobs and calls analyzer  
3. review command displays interactive Rich table UI

The CLI app is imported from __main__ since there's no cli.py yet.
The tests will FAIL because:
- Current CLI just echoes messages without calling real functions
- No cli.py module exists to import scraper/analyzer/database functions
